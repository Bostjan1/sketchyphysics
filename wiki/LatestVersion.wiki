= Installation =
Basically you just unzip the file into your Sketchup/Plugins directory. If you don't know what that means.... 

==Simplified Installation==
  # Open the SketchyPhysics ZIP file in WinZip. Don't even bother looking at all of the files in there because it will only confuse you.
  # Click the "Actions" toolbar and select "Extract" from the dropdown menu.
  # Go to C:\Program Files\Google\Google Sketchup 6\Plugins
  # Hit Enter

If you have done everything correctly the directories should look like this.
{{{
 Google Sketchup 6
  Plugins
    SketchyPhysics.rb
    Win32.so
    SketchyPhysics<dir>
      SketchyPhysicsTool.rb
      PrimsTool.rb
      <etc>
}}}
