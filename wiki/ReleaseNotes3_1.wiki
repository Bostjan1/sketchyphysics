#summary SP3.1 Release Notes

= SketchyPhysics 3.1 Release Notes =

While this version was over a year in the making it is largely the same as SP3x. The biggest change is that this is a formal version and models can be posted to 3dwarehouse. That said there are a few very exciting features in this release, including sound support and some very powerful new scripting commands. Plus some bug fixes that were long over due.
