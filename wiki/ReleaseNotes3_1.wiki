#summary SP3.1 Release Notes

= SketchyPhysics 3.1 Release Notes =

While this version was over a year in the making it is largely the same as SP3x. The biggest change is that this is a formal version and models can be posted to 3dwarehouse. That said there are a few very exciting features in this release, including sound support and some very powerful new scripting commands. Plus some bug fixes that were long over due. 


= Changes since SketchyPhysics3RC1 =

 * Sound support. Wav files can be embedded in models for playback at runtime.

= Bugs fixed since SketchyPhysics3RC1 =

 * Fixed bug where operations (like create solids) were slow when the outliner was open.
 * Fixed bug with groups that only contained one group. May break existing models but oh well...
 * Fixed FOV not being saved by at simulation start.
